# Iris Flower Classification ðŸŒ¸

This project uses machine learning to classify Iris flowers into one of three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, or **Virginica**. The classification is based on measurements of the flowers' physical characteristics, such as petal and sepal lengths and widths.

## Project Overview
The **Iris dataset** is one of the most well-known datasets in data science and machine learning. It contains 150 samples of Iris flowers, each with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a label specifying the species of the flower.

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify a given Iris flower based on its features into one of the three species.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 150 samples and is available from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikrishnan/iris-dataset). The features in the dataset are:

### Features:
1. **Sepal Length** (cm)
2. **Sepal Width** (cm)
3. **Petal Length** (cm)
4. **Petal Width** (cm)

### Labels (Target):
- **Iris-setosa**
- **Iris-versicolor**
- **Iris-virginica**

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DeMoN-7/Iris-Flower-Classification.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Iris-Flower-Classification
   ```

3. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Once installed, you can run the project by executing the main script:

1. Make sure you have the dataset in the proper location or fetch it from Kaggle.
   
2. Run the classification script:
   ```bash
   python iris_classification.py
   ```

This will train the model and display the evaluation metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
